Throughout the extent of this final project, I've come to a mildly intriguing conclusion. I'm frankly really bad at effort estimation. I tend to severely overestimate the complexity of an issue and estimate an uncomfortable amount of time to complete it. Most of the time, I've proven myself wrong once I've actually taken on a task. "Oh this wasn't as bad as I thought" has been a common thought resurfacing in my head every time I got through a problem. I guess that goes back to how we estimated time. Whenever we would encounter a new issue that needed to be created, a lot of the time we wouldn't exactly think too deeply about how we would go about implementing a solution. Most of the time the process summed up to "Dang, this is gonna suck," which ended up creating quite a few issues with astronomically large time estimations and an actual implementation time of a fraction of that. Looking back at it now, this wasn't exactly the most effective way to estimate since we were most times insanely inaccurate. When we encountered problems we had some level of familiarity with, whether we've worked on it before or we've seen examples of it, those estimates were generally pretty close to what we actually needed. However, especially in the case of new issues, we would exaggerate the complexity and slap on an astronomically large time just to give it a label and move on. Looking at it a different way, we could have used it as a way to identify "unknown" issues that we haven't had experience with.

## Did our estimates do... anything?

I think that our estimates did somewhat help us. For topics we were more comfortable with, yeah, we were able to use our estimates and work around them. With new topics however, I do think it ironically *did* help us a little bit despite being inaccurate because seeing that large estimate makes the problem seem more daunting than it actually was, and so when taking it on, we felt that we needed to prepare *mentally* to work on it. For me, at least, this helped me to stay focused while I looked into the issue. Someone's gotta do it, and so despite it being daunting, I'd have to look for a solution somehow. The only issue was honestly the mental preparation. Sometimes it seemed *too* daunting to attempt and it would leave a topic on the side for a while. Then, when we decide to actually pick it up, it turns out it wasn't as bad as we estimated. So, it did create a bit of wasted time when getting started, and so that is definitely a major drawback that we faced. However, since we were already prepared to face a difficult problem, it was somewhat easier to work through them since we already prepared for it from the start.

We were able to learn from these estimates and get closer estimates for other issues that were related and as I mentioned before, we were able to work around these estimations well for topics we were already familiar with.
