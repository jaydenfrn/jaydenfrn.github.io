This was an extracurricular high school project that my team and I were hand-picked for. Its purpose was to help motivate and guide current high school students who may be lost or confused about what direction they should aim for in their life. We personally contacted and scheduled interviews with former alumni to inquire about what they went through on their way to success. The struggles they faced, the strategies they used to overcome said struggles, and any other advice they may have for those who may be searching for their own path.

My main job in this team was as an interviewer and a video editor. I worked with our artist to structure and design each interview video, sifting through the content for important comments and interesting sections. When these videos are completed, they are broadcast to the students of the high school during the morning news, in hopes of getting the attention of the students struggling to find their place and possibly finding an answer through our videos.
