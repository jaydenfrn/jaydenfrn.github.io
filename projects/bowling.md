---

I was a part of the group of my friends that planned and organized our bowling night. We all have incredibly busy schedules, so it is difficult to find a day where we are all able to meet up at the same time. In order to make it happen, we had to communicate between individuals and organize a collective schedule to find days off and a possible time block for the event. We needed to adapt for unexpected hiccups as the day got closer, so we made sure to find multiple days and times that could work in the cases that one failed. 

Due to this, we were able to successfully meet up and spend time together.
