summary: "Learning to assemble, test, and troubleshoot racing drones for a competitive event"

In high school, I was a part of a Robotics club and one of our new activities that year was a drone racing event. I never actually got to the point of competing, however, I was one of the students who was tasked with working on the drones themselves. Me, along with my small team of 3 people, were given the task of assembling the racing drones for the team's use. These drones were truly a DIY project. They gave us motors, propellers, circuit boards, and wires, and required us to assemble them. This included sautering, which I'm not particularly amazing at. Luckily there were only a handful of drones that needed assembly, as we didn't have funds for more. 

We didn't exactly divide up the roles amongst our team, we all took a couple of drones to assemble and got to work. That includes wiring, sautering, assembly, flashing the motherboard, testing, and troubleshooting. The first drone wasn't exactly pretty, but it got the job done decently enough and was a valuable experience that taught us what *not* to do when assembling the drone, such as what way the propellers are meant to face and where the wires are meant to be sautered onto. The rest of the drones were a lot more recognizable as functioning drones. They flew decently stable and didn't have propellers flying off when trying to turn too hard. This project really taught us how basic drones function and made us learn how to troubleshoot physical technical issues.
