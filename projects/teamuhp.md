Many college students want to build real-world experience and strengthen their resumes through hands-on projects. However, the scope and complexity of meaningful and large-scale projects may exceed their current technical skills or confidence. Such a gap makes it difficult for students to initiate or complete projects that truly showcase their abilities.

TeamUHP! is a platform for students to connect across areas of study by enabling them to upload project postings and recruit collaborators. Whether it’s a class assignment or a passion project, students can find teammates with complementary skills and allow each contributor to play a meaningful role that aligns with their field of study. This medium of collaboration helps students to gain practical experience, build teamwork skills, and add completed projects to their resumes.

In TeamUHp! I was was of the backend developers who worked on adding functionality and creating pages that communicate back and forth between our remote database.
